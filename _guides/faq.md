## Repository

### What happened to the original author?

A: The original author szokodiakos (github name) [has abandoned the project](https://github.com/szokodiakos/typegoose/issues/99#issuecomment-364639150), but might look into it again at some time

### Is this Project still active?

A:
Short: Yes it is<br/>
Long: Yes it is, but not on the main repo anymore because of [What happened to the original author?](#what-happened-to-the-original-author) and [Github Permissions](https://help.github.com/en/articles/permission-levels-for-a-user-account-repository) (for short: a collaborator cannot add another collaborater, only the owner can)

### Why is the package now released in another package?

(context: from `typegoose` to `@hasezoey/typegoose`)<br/>
A: Because of a Repository Switch ([reasons](#is-this-project-still-active)) and because a name cannot be used by multiple packages except if it is scoped

### Why @hasezoey/typegoose

A: because the normal `typegoose` is still working, and i dont want to deal with it, `@hasezoey/typegoose` is perfectly fitting (and because of the repo differences)
